The ANC says: \"We have a good story to tell,\" implying that South Africans - under the ANC-led government - have for the past 20 years been making history.","Is it true?","It would be impossible to answer this question without understanding how white people made history in South Africa before 1994. The Frontier Wars (fought between 1779 and 1879) were essentially about clearing natives from their land to make space for white settlers.","While some historians contend that this is what redefined South Africa, the making of history \"proper\" was triggered by the discovery of diamonds in Kimberley in 1867 and gold in the Witwatersrand in 1886.","We say history proper because it was from this point onwards that the social character of South Africa acquired an economic logic that has since operated unendingly.","The Randlords, a group of white mine owners who organised themselves into a powerful cartel, constructed a social hierarchy that remains intact in mining today.","This group was led by Cecil John Rhodes.","What did they do?","As early as the last quarter of the 19th century, the Randlords decided that, in the economy, a white man would be at the top of the social hierarchy and that a black man must permanently supply cheap labour in the service of the white man.","In the context of historic animosity between the English and Afrikaners, Cecil John Rhodes and his fellow moguls conspired to exclude Afrikaners from economic benefit, but a political deal was eventually cemented in 1910, allowing all whites to exploit black labour.","Since then blacks have continued to be used to propel production in mines owned largely by the English and in farms and firms owned mainly by Afrikaners.","This meant that waking up each day, black men had to be loaded onto trains, buses and taxis to go and work in mines, farms and factories owned by white people.","To guarantee perpetuity in this arrangement, whites - from Rhodes to Verwoerd - made certain that black people were never given a good education.","Chiefly the aim was to prevent black social mobility, and to maintain the material conditions for white supremacy.","Racism was a psycho-social tool to mobilise the collaboration of the vast majority of whites in the construction of an economic scheme that guaranteed them an elevated social status.","Standing in 1994, looking back over the past 342 years, what appeared clearly was a historic process that placed whites at the top and blacks at the bottom.","Given this, the evaluation of the historical significance of the past 20 years cannot be reduced to the dramatic triviality of counting RDP houses or the number of households that now have electricity.","The serious business of history proper must be about the deconstruction of the economic logic designed by Cecil John Rhodes and his ilk.","As already pointed out, the reality before 1994 was that every morning blacks had to catch trains, buses and taxis to go and work for white men.","Twenty years into democracy, do the people of Soweto, Mdantsane or Kwamashu still wake up to go and work in white-owned mines, farms or factories?","What of the millions of unemployed black people; do they hope to find work in companies owned by black capitalists?","Where are such companies, and what do they manufacture? This brings us to the ANC\u0027s illusion of history.","Since there are now a few BEE millionaires, who made money from minority stakes in white-owned companies, the ANC is misled to see \"a good story\" that does not exist.","The truth is that Cyril Ramaphosa\u0027s rise to the millionaire\u0027s paradise has done nothing to alter Cecil John Rhodes\u0027s logic - that in the mines, black men must work underground untrained and underpaid.","It would indeed be hard to find evidence of the contribution of Ramaphosa\u0027s new millionaire status to economic growth in South Africa.","The only new thing is that, following Ramaphosa\u0027s entry, the boardroom at Lonmin has diluted its lily-whiteness, even though the black entrant exudes no signs of discomfort about the shooting down of black workers.  On their part, poor black people get nothing from Ramaphosa\u0027s wealth.","He flies his family and friends in his private jet. The poor see a plane in the sky, not a good story to tell.","The ANC\u0027s illusion of history is also generated by the palpability of the black middle class, largely a post-1994 phenomenon. It is true that, in the main, members of the black middle class do not work for white men; they work for the state and its extensions.","This is what makes black bureaucrats feel they are part of the \"good story to tell\".","The true story to tell, though, is that bureaucrats do not produce wealth.","They, as Walter Rodney points out, \"squander the wealth created by the peasants and workers by purchasing cars, whisky, and perfume\".","The irony is that, 20 years into democracy, the cars, whisky and suits purchased by the black middle class are not made by Cyril Ramaphosa. They are made in Germany, Scotland and Italy.","This means the escape made by a few black people from the white man\u0027s reservoir of cheap labour has simply converted the escapees from labourers to consumers.","Just like Ramaphosa\u0027s rise to the millionaire\u0027s paradise, the black middle class change of status from labourers to consumers left Cecil John Rhodes\u0027s economic system unchanged.","The \"good story to tell\" illusion also arises from the exuberance of the black politicians who now sit at the helm of state power.","Imagine the feelings of a former liberation struggle fighter who, suddenly, finds himself living in a palace worth more than R246 million in Nkandla.","The head of such a politician can very easily generate phantoms of \"good stories\", forgetting that, concretely, nothing has changed in the lives of the majority of black people.","It should by now be plainer that history is not reducible to a mere piece of new labour-relations legislation, nor can it be thought of in terms of  Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) houses, water and electricity.","History proper entails the fundamental redefinition of social relations.","This is not done by dishing out a dose of good stories.","It does not matter how energetic storytellers may be, blacks are still the suppliers of cheap labour to white-owned mines in Marikana, to farms in the Free State and factories on the East Rand.","Instead of wasting time manufacturing good stories, the ANC would serve itself well by learning from what white people did in South Africa.","The most important lesson is that black people are not the first to experience poverty and unemployment in our country; whites, too, were once poor and unemployed.","Historians coined the phrase \"poor white problem\" to describe the terrible penury that afflicted white people from the late 19th century well into the 20th century.","Today, poverty as a percentage of white society is 0.8 percent. How did they do it?","Four factors were at play: (1) state support; (2) productive work; (3) education; and (4) cheap black labour.","The English employed these measures to eradicate poverty among themselves.","They worked hard to build mines from scratch; they used state power to support their businessmen; they gave their citizens quality education and they exploited black labour. The Afrikaners, too, worked to establish commercial farming, the steel industry and other ventures.","Their businessmen were supported by the state, including the building of good schools for Afrikaner children.","And, indeed, the Afrikaners exploited black labour. What did the ANC do over the past 20 years?","It preached the gospel of the easily-gotten good life.","This gave rise to BEE tycoons and a large pool of social grant recipients.","This is how the spirit of hard work among blacks was suffocated.","The ANC also used state power to distribute tenders, thereby producing a new class of unproductive and rapacious tenderpreneurs. Regrettably, the party also did very little to improve the quality of public education for blacks.","The worst thing is that BEE tycoons cannot even create jobs for the masses of unemployed black people.","Twenty years into democracy, the vast majority of black people still hope to find work in mines, farms and factories owned by whites. This might remain unchanged for the next 100 years.","If the ANC continues to wallow in the delusion of \"good stories\", history will appear like trees to a child in a moving car - a motion that does not exist.","*Mashele is co-author of The Fall of the ANC: What Next.","** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.","Sunday Independent"],"section":"sundayindependent","articleId":"the-illusion-of-good-stories-to-tell","title":"The illusion of good stories to tell","numDate":"20140518","relatedArticleList":[{"title":"NP can teach a thing or two about longevity","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/news/politics/np-can-teach-a-thing-or-two-about-longevity-1.379280","path":"article/np-can-teach-a-thing-or-two-about-longevity"}],"description":"The ANC must learn from the history of white South Africans to understand how to build wealth, writes Prince Mashele.","imageCaption":"ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, President Jacob Zuma and Dr Malinga, dance onstage as the party celebrated its victory in the 2014 elections at Library Gardens in Johannesburg.

CÃ©sar Milstein, the Argentinian biochemist, recalls that in 1966 during the Night of the Long Police Batons, Juan Carlos OnganÃ­a seized power from the government, declaring that \"our country would be put in order as soon as all the intellectuals who were meddling in the region were expelled\".","The Maoist Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot in Kampuchea (1975-79) meted out the most hideous brutality against intellectuals.","He ordered the \"mass killing of intellectuals, professional people, and city dwellers - over a million of his people. People were killed for being academics or for merely wearing eyeglasses (as it suggested literacy) in the Killing Fields\".","When Paulo Neves Freire, the Brazilian philosopher, authored the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, the 1964 military coup regime jailed him.","They classified him as a traitor and banned him from Brazil.","Anti-intellectualism is a common tactic of dictatorships to suppress political dissent.","Beyers NaudÃ©, Bram Fischer, Ingrid Jonker, AndrÃ© Brink, Breyten Breytenbach, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, Max du Preez and his Vrye Weekblad newspaper, Koos Kombuis, Stephen Kemp, Antjie Krog, Carl Niehaus and the VoÃ¯lvry musicians all risked being killed.","These were mostly Afrikaners who, with their voices and actions, fought against what was perceived to be the absolute norm of the day.","They were prepared to die for their convictions. Rejecting the comfort, even opulence, that came with conformism, they were the apartheid counter-revolutionaries. All were educated, intellectuals, authors or newspaper owners.","These were the \"clever Afrikaners\". Likewise, Walter Rubusana, Alan Kirkland Soga, Sol Plaatje, John Tengo Jabavu, John L Dube (Ngcobo), Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Alfred Mangena, Dr J S Moroka, Anton Lembede, Steve Biko, Robert Sobukwe and Archie Gumede were educated intellectuals, authors and newspaper owners.","They disowned the comfort that came with their professions. They refused to be deceived and bought out by the repressive and brutal regime.","They were the \"clever blacks\". The ANC was conceived by \"clever blacks\". Nkosi Sikelel\u0027 iAfrika was composed by a \"clever black\"!","The ANC was the midwife and a bunker (the safe house) of the \"clever blacks\".","We are where we are today because of our forbears who were undeniably the \"clever blacks\" of their generation.","In all fairness, it is anti-ANC to victimise and despise intellectualism.","Political schools, academic scholarships and many other initiatives aimed at developing the intellectual talents of its members were paramount for the sustainability and progression of the ANC in exile.","A number of young lions left the country with an intention to become liberation soldiers.","They were taken aback when, arriving in the ANC camps, the emphasis was more on education than carrying an AK47.","In the world history of liberation movements it is only the ANC that had a formal school. Oliver Tambo was deeply devoted to preparing clever cadres who would be up to the challenge of governing our country in what became the information age.","Subsequently a number of ANC cadres were offered academic scholarships.","Inside the country, the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM) was headed by respected and well-educated leaders.","Teachers, priests, academics, students and pupils were placed at the forefront of our struggle. The MDM, like the ANC, preferred meritocracy to mediocrity.","It is for this reason that it is very difficult to point out a single leader who was below par in terms of intellectual acumen.","The ANC, like other liberation movements, managed to infiltrate academic tertiary institutions and turn them into centres of progressive and robust intellectual debate and activism.","University students were encouraged to contribute their intellectual skills and recruiting strategies. Political leadership was exclusive and a reserved terrain for the clever people.","There was no spewing of empty party-political rhetoric. A well-thought, carefully thought and clearly articulated ideological argument was much more respected.","People were free and encouraged to explore their own personal intellectual pathways. The \"clever blacks\" were highly admired.","They were the leaders of society. The ANC was not then afraid of intellectual discourse as it was not deficient in ethics and morality.","Livelihoods and socially upward mobility were not obtained by worshipping at the altar of blind party loyalty, corruption, and patronage politics.","In those days, the ANC and MDM were progressive institutions committed to intellectual grooming and growth. The apartheid government hated the ANC, MDM and other liberation movements because it knew that they were the incubators of \"clever blacks\".","Despite the Nationalists\u0027 best efforts to use \"Bantu education\" to suppress the intellectual capability of the black people, the black intellectual voice only became louder.","Black people yearned for political education and to know more about their oppressive social conditions and how to dismantle them.","The black intellectuals, or should I say the \"clever blacks\", stood in the gap and marched at the forefront of a movement that boldly demanded equality before the law.","They were labelled agents provocateurs, guerrillas and socialists. The most interesting assertion from the apartheid government was that these \"clever blacks\" were misleading people and bad-mouthing a stable and caring government.","The \"clever blacks\" who were caught reflecting the true living conditions of black people through writing, art, and in any other form of expression, and reading enlightening books such as Let My People Go and Chief with a Double Agenda, were poisoned, jailed or exiled among other similarly brutal punishments.","Now we have come full circle! Indeed, as the French say, plus \u0026ccedil;a change, plus c\u0027est la mÃªme chose (the more things change the more they stay the same).","Nowadays our own President Jacob Zuma keeps on directing his wrath against black intellectuals. Referring to them as \"clever blacks\", Zuma warned his followers that \"people who write in papers are educated. They think they are telling the truth. It is not\u0026hellip; It is propaganda that is very dangerous.\"","He further slammed black people \"who become too clever\", saying \"they become the most eloquent in criticising themselves about their own traditions\".","All these utterances were delivered \"in an angry-sounding tone\", according to the news reporters.","What makes our president so petrified of the \"educated\" and those \"who write in papers\"? His hostility towards the most capable among our citizens begs a lot of questions about his true agenda at educating the nation.","Our president must visit James Baldwin and he will understand that \"the paradox of education is precisely this - that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated\".","Newspapers have for over a century been one of South Africa\u0027s most vibrant public forums, where people have contested and expressed their ideas and opinions.","When a leader of the ruling party openly expresses his contempt for the educated, writers, and public intellectuals, surely this will cascade down to ordinary party members?","Is it sacrilege to commit yourself to truth for the sake of the prosperity of our country?","When our own people spurn the voice of reason, one wonders what would be the reaction of such luminaries as HIE Dhlomo, Benedict Wallet Vilakazi, EAM Made, CLS Nyembezi, Nimrod Njabulo Ndebele, Albert Luthuli, Jordan K Ngubane, RRR Dhlomo, Mazisi Kunene, Selby DB Ngcobo, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Walter MB Nhlapo, Rueben Caluza, Anton Lembede, Selby Msimang, Richard Msimang, Alfred Mangena, Congress Mbata, Lewis Nkosi, Nat Nakasa, JC Dlamini, AHM Ngidi and Josiah Mapumulo.","These brave South African intellectuals, who were from KwaZulu-Natal by birth, suffered at the hands of the apartheid government.","They were determined, through rational and vigorous debate, to trumpet the voice of all black South Africans in discussions of social and national importance.","They never shrank from the challenge of creating a more normal society for the next generation.","Today we are celebrating this \"freedom\" because of their sacrifices.","History has proven that power evaporates, but the truth always prevails.","Time is the ultimate judge. It is difficult today to find a white person associating him or herself with apartheid.","In a not too distant past, people were scared to quote and be associated with former president Thabo Mbeki.","It is still relatively a crime to mention his name within certain circles of the ANC.","There is a concerted effort to airbrush Mbeki out of the history of the ANC.","Only the T-shirts with the face of Nelson Mandela and Jacob Zuma were distributed for this year\u0027s general election campaign.","Yet the probabilities are high that in a very near future President Jacob Zuma shall be alone in his Nkandla homestead and no one shall wear a T-shirt with his image.","The most amazing and undeniable fact is that the \"clever blacks\" shall always be with us until the return of Jesus Christ, who was, incidentally, also very clever.","The clever people, in general, and \"clever blacks\", in particular, will never disappear; instead, they will multiply.","The perpetuation of intellectual terror by the president of our country makes one wonder what is the position of the next generation of ANC leadership?","Here I am talking about people like David Makhura, Nomfanelo Kota, Malusi Gigaba, Lindiwe Zulu, Dr Makhosi Khoza, Nkenke Kekana, Jacob Mamabolo, Mlibo Qoboshiyane, Fikile Mbalula, Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, Lulu Johnson, Mpho Parks Tau, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, Goodenough Kodwa, Sihle Zikalala, Sonwabile Mancotywa, Buti Manamela, Nkosinathi Mthethwa, Mduduzi Manana, and many more of the finest minds of the ANC.","Pardon me for placing you all under the microscope while deployments are not yet concluded.","Nevertheless, the future shall demand explanations and answers.","The true cadres of the ANC who are patriotic South Africans must continue subscribing to Es\u0027kia Mphahlele\u0027s doctrine to always make people, especially the \"clever people\", resist sinking \"to the degenerate level of Afrikaans writers in South Africa who have always censored themselves and not dared to challenge the government because it has Calvinist boer origins, like themselves. Because they are all a tribe\".","The most bothering aspect of the \"clever black\" concept is the fact that it solely targets black people.","Indians, coloureds and whites are allowed to be clever.","Are black people not supposed to be analytical and clever? Are we not supposed to be the knowledge innovators?","Why does the president want us to be imbeciles, the idiots, morons and cretins of our society?","Like the emperor who could tolerate in his court none more learned than himself, he will bring disaster upon our land.","Meanwhile, there are countless young black people who are so clever and committed to our country. They are energetic to find solutions to our societal ills.","To paraphrase Ntongela Masilela, they are \"the intellectuals who in practice and commitment are characterised by a high moral seriousness\".","The only gift that Zuma and the ANC can give to the next generation is if they prioritise intellectual development and lead our society to a better future, spurn rapacious self-aggrandisement, and commit themselves to public service.","Ngugi wa Thiong\u0027o, a Kenyan intellectual and writer who refused to be silenced, said, \"Certain people told me that this story was too disgraceful, too shameful, that it should be concealed\u0026hellip; There were others who claimed that it was a matter for tears and sorrow, that it should be suppressed so that we should not shed tears a second time.","\"I asked them: How can we cover up pits in our courtyard with leaves or grass, saying to ourselves that because our eyes cannot now see the holes, our children can prance about the yard as they like?","\"Happy is the man who is able to discern the pitfalls in his path, for he can avoid them.\"","*Dube is a senior researcher at  Xubera Institute for Research and Development.","** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.","Sunday Independent"],"section":"sundayindependent","articleId":"clever-blacks-will-always-be-here","title":"Clever blacks will always be here","numDate":"20140518","relatedArticleList":[{"title":"Why presidents should read","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/pretoria-news/opinion/why-presidents-should-read-1.1585684","path":"article/why-presidents-should-read"},{"title":"Mbeki for rich, Zuma for poor?

While they may like to post pictures of themselves online, Millennials agree with adults from other generations that, in general, people share too much information about themselves on the internet.\"","Taken casually or staged, a picture of you, posted by you, is always done deliberately.","There is control and essentially the opportunity to present \"Me, through my eyes\".","Durban theatre personality Rory Booth says the few selfies he\u0027s taken have left him \"embarrassed\" and \"regretful\".","\"I understand wanting to share moments you have with the people around you with the rest of the world. However, the majority of selfies I have seen, just smack of self-obsession,\" he says.","\"For example, the other day I saw a selfie of someone who posted a picture hashtagged \u0027vulnerable\u0027.","A few minutes later the same person posted a selfie with the hashtag \u0027model\u0027. How did this person get from vulnerable to model in a matter of seconds?","\"I guess people are looking for validation in society. In which cases selfies must boost one\u0027s confidence.","\"Selfies can be a form of expressing oneself - and some people paint beautiful pictures - but solo selfies are just not for me.\"","Booth\u0027s sentiment is the core of another solid argument: that selfies are an extension of art and may even have cultural reference in the way art, such as Van Gogh\u0027s self-portraits, do today.","We\u0027ve all done them at some stage, the issue is with those who do them too often and inappropriately.","I won\u0027t even go into the porno or near porno pictures of flexing muscles and pouting guises that flood the internet.","But take it from US President Barack Obama, who was caught participating in a \"selfie\" at Nelson Mandela\u0027s memorial service with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, that there is a time and place for everything.","Perhaps taking selfies is far more innocent than labels such as \"narcissism\" allow.","One woman we\u0027re all happy to see selfies of is model Shashi Naidoo. Her last selfie was taken about a week ago on a helicopter flip in Mozambique.","Naidoo says she posts selfies \"spontaneously\".","\"Taking selfies is not something I usually plan. Sometimes it\u0027s spur of the moment, sometimes after I get my hair done, before a shoot or after getting my make-up done.","\"Instagram has created a whole new culture where we can share pictures in real time. I don\u0027t always have make-up on, I am as real as the next girl,\" she says.","Another celebrity, somewhat more articulate about what social media has done for his brand, is Hollywood heartthrob James Franco.","Franco wrote a letter to the New York Times last  December making an argument for the power of attention.","Selfies, he says, \"are tools of communication more than marks of vanity \u0026hellip; Mini-Mes that we send out to give others a sense of who we are\".","Maybe you should be worried if you aren\u0027t a celebrity and aren\u0027t confident enough to be posting like one anyway.","A recent BBC report revealed research linking selfies to body image.","It suggests spending lots of time on Facebook looking at pictures of friends could make women insecure about their body image.","Researchers at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, and the University of Iowa in the US surveyed 881 US female college students and found a link between time spent on social networks and negative comparisons about body image.","In the report Petya Eckler of the University of Strathclyde said, \"The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know.","\"These comparisons are much more relevant and hit closer to home. Yet they may be just as unrealistic as the images we see on traditional media.\" - The Mercury","l Follow me on twitter @omeshnie"],"section":"scitech","articleId":"me-my-selfie-and-i","title":"Me, my selfie and I","numDate":"20140518","relatedArticleList":[{"title":"Rise of the \u0027Insta-babes\u0027","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/scitech/technology/internet/rise-of-the-insta-babes-1.1636631","path":"article/rise-of-the-insta-babes"},{"title":"The science behind the selfie","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/scitech/technology/news/the-science-behind-the-selfie-1.1654138","path":"article/the-science-behind-the-selfie"},{"title":"Girl sparks selfies minus makeup craze","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/scitech/technology/internet/girl-sparks-selfies-minus-makeup-craze-1.1666434","path":"article/girl-sparks-selfies-minus-makeup-craze"},{"title":"How to take the ultimate selfie","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/scitech/technology/gadgets/how-to-take-the-ultimate-selfie-1.1667943","path":"article/how-to-take-the-ultimate-selfie"}],"description":"Aided and abetted by cellphone cameras and social media networks, the narcissistic wave is epitomised by the selfie.","imageCaption":"Mercury reporter Sphelele Ngubane takes a selfie.

Apply mascara immediately after curling to hold the shape.\"","Use a matchbox to file your nails","A split nail can be infuriating and will catch on everything until it\u0027s filed down. If you don\u0027t have an emery board or clippers to hand, try the beauty editors\u0027 favourite fast fix and search for a box of matches.","\"The strike strip - the bit you run the matches along - makes a surprisingly effective emergency nail file,\u0027 says Roxanne Campbell, current UK Manicurist of the Year.","Coffee filters to keep your skin dry","Does your skin tend to look shiny within hours of applying make-up? Facial blotting papers, which come in a book or pouch, are a great way to soak up oil but can cost a lot if you use them every day.","Frugal beauty bloggers say a much cheaper option is hiding in your kitchen. Chosen because they are highly absorbent and lint-free, coffee filters, cut into strips, will soak up oil as well as any blotter, for a long-lasting matt effect.","Post-Its for eyeliner","Love the Sixties \"kitten eye\" look of thick black eyeliner that flicks up at the outer corners - but find drawing those neat lines difficult? Try using the sticky edge of a Post-it note as a guide, says celebrity make-up artist Julia Carta. It works best with a soft black pencil rather than gel or liquid liners, which are likely to smudge.","\"Begin by sticking a small sticky note on to the skin at the side of your eye at an almost vertical angle,\" she says. \"Using the edge of the note as a ruler, decide where you want the tail of your flick to finish and draw in from there, working along the stickie, and in and along the lid with feathered strokes.\"","Ring reinforcer for a French manicure","You don\u0027t need to pay a fortune to get a French manicure. You can get the professional look by using ring reinforcers (the sticky circles with a hole that stop paper tearing in a ring binder) to help you paint neat nail tips in minutes.","Begin by sticking a reinforcer on each nail, leaving a \u0026frac12;cm sliver between the tip and the upper edge of the sticky circle. Now paint the tips in your colour of choice.","Wait for the polish to dry completely before removing the reinforcers. Finally, paint the entire nail with two coats of clear polish for a chic, finished look.","Cooking oil to dry nails","Manicurists will often spritz freshly painted nails with a special oil to make the polish dry more quickly. But did you know that cooking spray - the oil you buy in a can and use to lubricate a pan - can also cut drying time by half?","\"Although it\u0027s not quite as fast and effective as the specially formulated manicure spray, a spritz of cooking oil will help nails to dry more quickly,\" says Roxanne Campbell.","Once you\u0027ve painted your nails, hold them over a sink or protected surface and give them a light spritz of oil. Hold the can 30cm from your nails as you spray to avoid damaging the finish.","\"Use plain oil rather than a low fat or flavoured type and don\u0027t try spritzing with a refillable pump-action spray - it\u0027s the propellant in the pressurised can that helps the polish dry,\" says Campbell.","Tumble dryer sheet to stop flyaway hair","Online tipsters say stroking a tumble dryer sheet over flyaway hair will instantly remove static and leave your hair smelling fresh.","\"It certainly makes sense,\" says Ondine Cowley, artistic director at Nicky Clarke salons. \"The conditioner in the sheet should reduce static and add shine.\"","If you don\u0027t have dryer sheets, Cowley says applying a little hairspray to your palms - letting it dry for a few seconds, then running it over your hair - should do the trick.","An old toothbrush is the ultimate tool","If you suffer from flaky lips, cover them with a creamy cleanser and gently scrub in circles with a clean toothbrush to remove rough and peeling skin.","A clean toothbrush also makes an excellent eyebrow groomer - and is often used by hairdressers to tame stray baby hairs. \"Just spritz the toothbrush with a little hairspray,\" says Cowley, \"and stroke ever so gently over your up-do or fringe to get a beautifully groomed result.\"","Make-up artist Julia Carta sometimes dips a toothbrush in a little moisturiser and uses it to buff away areas of patchy fake tan on knees, ankles and knuckles. \"I also use a toothbrush dipped in lemon juice or toothpaste to clean and whiten polish-stained nails.\" - Daily Mail"],"section":"lifestyle","articleId":"beauty-tools-from-your-kitchen","title":"Beauty tools from your kitchen","numDate":"20140518","relatedArticleList":[{"title":"You wear what you eat","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/lifestyle/style/fashion/you-wear-what-you-eat-1.1027901","path":"article/you-wear-what-you-eat"},{"title":"Beauty treatments from your pantry","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/lifestyle/style/beauty/beauty-treatments-from-your-pantry-1.1314102","path":"article/beauty-treatments-from-your-pantry"},{"title":"Health in your backyard","source":"http://www.iol.co.za:80/lifestyle/style/beauty/health-in-your-backyard-1.1375799","path":"article/health-in-your-backyard"}],"description":"Before you buy another beauty product or gizmo, it might be worth taking a look round your home.","imageCaption":"An old toothbrush is the ultimate tool.","imageCredit":"AFP","articlePath":"article/beauty-tools-from-your-kitchen.json"}]
